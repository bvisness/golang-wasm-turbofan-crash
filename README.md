# Golang WASM Turbofan Crash

chrome go boom

## How go boom

Requirements:

- Go 1.16 (other versions may work, but I haven't tested them)
- Chrome

Run either `run.sh` or `run.bat` depending on your platform. This will build the WASM file and run a webserver to view the results.

Go to `localhost:8989` in Chrome and enjoy a fully responsive page until it crashes. For extra fun, watch your memory use in Task Manager.
