# Golang WASM TurboFan Crash

chrome go boom

## How go boom

Requirements:

- Chrome

Run either `run.sh` or `run.bat` depending on your platform. This will run a local webserver on `localhost:8989` so you can view a web page with the WASM file.

Go to `localhost:8989` in Chrome and enjoy a fully responsive page until it crashes. For extra fun, watch your memory use in Task Manager.

## How build

Requirements:

- Go 1.16 (it may work with other versions, but I haven't tested it)

Run either `build.sh` or `build.bat` depending on your platform.
